## Quick start:

- please make sure you have installed the `environment for nodejs`. If you install it, install `nvm`, it helps us to manage multiple node versions and easily switch node versions.
- Make sure you have `nodemon` installed if not then use the command `npm install -g nodemon`.
- Install dependencies: `npm install` or `yarn`.
- Start the server: `nodemon app.js`.
- View locally on: `localhost:3500` || `localhost:3000`.
